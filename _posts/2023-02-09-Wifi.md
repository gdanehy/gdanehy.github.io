# Wifi Sensing Literature Review
The following is a presentation I gave to my research group on wifi sensing.

# A review of Deep Learning and Its Applications to WiFi Human Sensing
## The Paper 
Deep learning and its applications to WiFi human sensing: A benchmark and a tutorial

## What is Wi-Fi sensing
Also called WLAN Sensing
Analyzing the patterns of wireless signals in the form of Channel State Information
Analogous to using WiFi for Radar

## Use Cases
Device Free Human detection:
occupancy detection
activity recognition
fall detection
gesture recognition
human identification
people counting
More privacy friendly than cameras

## IEEE 802.11bf 
New wi-fi standard incorporating WiFi sensing in regular WiFi service
Currently under production, 2024 release date

## Current Wi-Fi sensing methods:
### Model Based
Physical models that describe the WiFi signals propagation
Works well for sensing single motions
- Breathing
- Falling down
- Occupancy detection
Origin WiFi? (Company that is trying to commercialize the technology)
### Learning Based
Able to perform complicated sensing tasks
- Gesture recognition
- Keystroke recognition
- activity recognition
- human identification 
- people counting
Require large amounts of labeled data
- Expensive 
- Environment Dependent

## Channel State Information
Describes how a signal propagates from the transmitter to the receiver
WiFi Access points usually have multiple antennas and subcarriers
CSI describes the phase shift of multi-path and amplitude attenuation on each subcarrier for a pair of transmitter and receiver antennas
CSI data has better resolutions for sensing compared to received signal strength

## Collecting CSI Data
There are a number of tools available to collect CSI data
- Some commonly used are the Intel 5300 NIC, Atheros CSI Tool, and Nexmon CSI Tool
- CSI tools are WiFi chip specific
I found a library called CSIkit that supports the following hardware:
- Qualcomm Atheros 802.11n Chipsets
- Intel IWL5300
- Broadcom BCM4358, BCM43455c0, BCM4366c0
- ESP32 via ESP32-CSI-Tool
This could be a good place to add to the field - develop software to extract CSI data from different sources

## CSI Data processing
CSI data consists of a vector of complex number including the amplitude and phase
The most common methodologies are:
- Only use the amplitude data as input - most common
- Use the CSI difference between antennas 
    - Used in model based methods
    - Requires clean data
- Use the processed Doppler representation of CSI.
   - eliminates the environmental dependency

## How Human Activities Affect CSI
CSI data for human sensing is composed of two dimensions: the subcarrier and the packet number
Each packet and the associated subcarrier information represent a “CSI Image”, a series of these represent a “CSI Video”
CSI Videos can describe human activity patterns
- Subcarrier dimension → spatial features
    - Pixels, convolutional layers
- Time dimension → temporal features
    - Can be modeled by recurrent neural networks
- Antenna dimension → resolution and channel features
    - similar to RGB channels of an image

## Deep Learning methods
Mostly Supervised Learning
More research is needed in unsupervised learning, it is promising in producing more generalized models

## Recommended Future Directions

Data-efficient learning
Model compression or lightweight model design
 - Important for real-time processing
Multi-modal learning
- Integrating WiFi sensing and visual recognition
Cross-modal learning
- reconstruct one modality from another modality
Model robustness and security for trustworthy sensing
- Protect privacy and against adversarial attacks
Complicated human activities and behaviors analytics
