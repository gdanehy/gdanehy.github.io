Ahoy! I'm Georgia, Welcome to my website!  

I am a Maker based in the Los Angeles area pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Southern California. 
I get excited about Technology, Urbanism, and obscure musical instruments!

At USC I was a member of [Viterbi Makers][makers-link], an interdisciplinary Engineering organization where the goal is to make cool stuff! I joined makers during the first semester of my freshman year, and since then I have served on the executive board as the Director of Marketing and Director of internal operations, and as a Project Manager for one of our clubs many projects!

I made this website to serve as a portfolio of all of my projects. Most are from hackathons or Makers, however, you may also see class projects or blog posts.
