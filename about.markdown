Ahoy! I'm Georgia, Welcome to my website! 

I am a Maker/Engineer based in the Bay area. I get excited about Technology, Urbanism, and obscure musical instruments!

I graduated from USC in 2024 with a degree in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. At USC I was a member of [Viterbi Makers][makers-link], an interdisciplinary Engineering organization where the goal is to make cool stuff! I joined makers during the first semester of my freshman year, and since then I have served on the executive board as the Director of Marketing and Director of internal operations, and as a Project Manager for one of our clubs many projects!

I made this website to serve as a portfolio of all of my projects.
