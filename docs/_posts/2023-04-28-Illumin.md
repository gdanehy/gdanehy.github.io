# Is my Wi-Fi watching me? - Illumin
**Abstract:**  
    This article provides an overview of Wi-Fi in its current state, and how it will be used in the future. The structure of Wi-Fi is examined from the ground up, beginning with the basics of radio waves and ending with the complex encoding strategies used to transmit as much data as possible. This information is used to explain new developments in Wi-Fi sensing, a method of sensing the world using Wi-Fi signals, such as the application of machine learning algorithms to channel state information. To conclude, potential uses and privacy implications of Wi-Fi sensing are discussed.

**Is my Wi-Fi watching me?**  
Wi-Fi: Those three little bars at the top of your phone screen. It is a technology that we use daily. When it is working, we don't think about it; but when the Wi-Fi is out, it can become a significant headache. The communication standard behind all of this is called IEEE 802.11. New research is expanding what Wi-Fi is capable of with Wi-Fi sensing. Soon, this protocol will not just send you information, it may also *see* movements using small changes in the radio waves.   

**What is WI-FI?**  
Wi-Fi is a signal used to transmit information using radio waves. Radio waves are just one part of the electromagnetic spectrum, comprising energy waves of different sizes. Other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are X-rays and visible light. X-rays and Visible light both have very short wavelengths. An X-ray's wavelength is so tiny, as small as the width of an atom (Figure 1), that it can pass through objects such as human bodies, making them useful for medical imaging \[1\]. Radio waves are much larger, with wavelengths anywhere from a few millimeters to a few thousand kilometers\! Because these electromagnetic waves are so long, they experience less distortion and interference over long distances. They can even bend around buildings \[1\].

Electromagnetic waves are speedy. They travel at the speed of light, making them some of the fastest things in the universe and very useful for communication \[1\]. One method of communication you have probably used before is radio broadcasting. For those under the age of 12, this is the ancient technology we used to listen to the news and music in the days before Spotify and cell phones\! Radio broadcasting comprises amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM). As the name implies, in AM radio, data is transmitted by changing an electromagnetic wave's vertical size, or amplitude. In contrast, in FM radio, the horizontal distance or frequency of the wave is changed \[2\]. These changes can then be translated into sound by your Radio receiver.

Both systems are still used today; however, AM radio has been falling out of fashion, with many new car radios unable to receive AM radio signals. AM radio is transmitted at a lower frequency than FM Radio, which means less data can be received. This results in worse sound quality and is not suitable for transmitting music. AM radio does have one trick up its sleeve, which is that it has a much more extensive range than FM radio. Therefore, people can still receive AM radio broadcasts even in remote areas \[2\].   

Radio stations are all broadcasted at slightly different frequencies, so their signals do not interfere. Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz), which is the number of cycles per second.

Similar to how multiple walkie-talkies on the same channel can result in lost or garbled transmissions, identical frequencies in Wi-Fi signals can cause the waves to disrupt each other.   

Different countries have regulatory bodies that allocate frequencies to different uses to prevent this from happening. This organization is called the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States. AM radio is broadcasted between 535-1605 kHz (103 Hz), whereas FM radio broadcasts between 88 and 108 MHz (106Hz) \[2\]. Wi-Fi is transmitted at even higher frequencies, between 2.4-60 GHz (109 Hz) \[3\]. Within each of these bands are multiple smaller slices on which data travels. So, when your phone is connected to a 2.4 GHz network, it is likely tuning into one of 11 different channels with frequencies between 2.412 and 2.462 GHz \[3\].

This is all fine and dandy, but how do computers translate between electromagnetic waves and the binary ones and zeros that the rest of the computer uses? First, data is translated into analog waves using techniques we have seen before, such as amplitude and frequency modulation, as well as another type of modulation called phase modulation or phase shift keying. In an FM radio wave, a lower frequency might represent a 0 in binary, and a higher frequency would represent a 1 in binary. Likewise, in AM data, a 0 is a low amplitude, and a 1 is a high amplitude. In phase modulation, each bit is represented by a wave, such as a sine for 1 or a cosine for 0, and these waves are strung together to communicate data. The magical thing about this is that all these methods can be used simultaneously, leaving multiple distinct options for longer bits. For example, a low amplitude cosine might represent the combination 00, while a high amplitude sine wave would represent the combination 11\. This is called Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) \[5\].

Using BPSK, Wi-Fi signals can effectively transmit more than 16 different bit combinations within a single transmission period. However, this isn't enough information to watch all of your favorite  cat videos in 4k. To transmit even more data,  Wi-Fi uses OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) which can cram multiple waveforms into a single radio transmission. An OFDM transmission contains different subcarriers, which are individual waveforms that have already undergone BPSK. These subcarriers are then transmitted orthogonally (at a right angle) so that the data do not interfere with each other.   

All of these bits would be meaningless unless they had an organizational structure. How would a computer know if data is for them or if it arrived correctly? This is what Wi-Fi packets do.  Packets can be thought of as letters, where data is the letter's content and addressing information is the envelope. These packets are routed between multiple Wi-Fi routers and servers and must undergo successive layers of packaging at each level of routing. Think of routing as sending a letter through USPS. The letter is first placed in a mailbox, then collected by a mail carrier and delivered to a post office. The letter then goes through a series of vehicles, sorting centers, and mailboxes before finally arriving at its destination, each time shedding and collecting labels and packaging to keep it safe and going in the right direction.

The transmission of Wi-Fi packets through the internet involves multiple layers of packaging and routing through different communication protocols such as Ethernet, HTTPS, and DNS \[6\]. A communication protocol is like a language for computers. It determines what frequencies to use, the format of the data and addressing information, methods for error detection and correction, and much more. The specific communication protocol behind Wi-Fi is called IEEE 802.11. It is governed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a professional organization that establishes and maintains standards for different protocols, such as Ethernet and Bluetooth. Despite what many people think, Wi-Fi does not stand for “Wireless Fidelity”; the name does not stand for anything\! A hired advertising firm just made it up \[7\].  

The Wi-Fi protocol 802.11 is often updated, with new updates coming out occasionally. A big update you might have heard of was Wi-Fi 6E, which expanded the protocol to include more high-frequency bands. However, one particularly interesting upcoming protocol change is 802.11bf, which includes guidelines on Wi-Fi sensing.   

**What is Wi-Fi Sensing?**  
Radio is often used for sensing techniques, for example, radar. Radar was originally a secret military technology developed to detect enemies. It works by sending out bursts of radio waves and listening for them to be reflected back. Based on the elapsed time between sending and receiving, radar systems can determine the distance and angle of objects in the system's path. Nowadays, radar systems are widely used. They can be found in most planes and ships to detect objects and avoid collisions; meteorologists even use them to detect weather systems \[8\].   
Wi-Fi sensing uses radio waves in another way. Instead of sending out signals and waiting for them to return, Wi-Fi Sensing leverages information collected while transmitting a packet over a wireless network. This information is known as channel state information (CSI), which can be used to describe how a signal propagates through a room \[9\]. Modern wireless routers and receivers often have multiple antennas and subcarriers for OFDM. CSI data is collected from pairs of these antennas. It encapsulates information on the amplitude, phase, and frequency response of signals after they have scattered, faded, and decayed in power due to distance on each subcarrier \[9\]. All of this information is then combined into one numerical value. On its own, a single piece of CSI data is not very useful. However, more data reveals patterns that can describe the world around us. There is CSI data for each packet and subcarrier. With multiple subcarriers and packets, you can combine these data points into an image of sorts. The more packets and subcarriers there are to collect data from, the higher the resolution of the CSI Image.

If a person moves around a room, how a Wi-Fi signal propagates will change. Therefore, changes in CSI data are indicative of movement. This alone can be useful for applications such as home security systems and smart homes. However, recent breakthroughs in machine learning have made this technology even more powerful. Humans can not easily pick out small patterns in CSI data, but machine learning algorithms can. Now researchers have been able to recognize human activities, gestures, and poses with only Wi-Fi signals \[9\]. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed deep learning algorithms that can recognize human poses at a similar accuracy as a camera system \[10\]. Other researchers at Michigan State University have developed ways to log keystrokes using finger movements collected in CSI data \[11\].

**So my Wi-Fi router can stalk me. Now what?**  
This may all seem scary, but the good news is that a universal system to classify fine-grain movements using Wi-Fi is years away. Models for classifying movements are hyper-specific to the location in which they are trained. If you bring any of these systems out of the laboratories they are trained in, they will no longer work. This is because training a machine learning model requires a lot of labeled data, and training a general model will require even more data. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you see it), there are very few CSI data sets. There is, however, an endless amount of data that can be collected. We just have to go out there and collect it!  

This technology does bring up many moral questions surrounding surveillance. Should engineers be making more tools to invade the privacy of others? I would argue that this technology has enough benefits that engineers should develop it further. A camera with a similar algorithm could do most things Wi-Fi sensing can do, but the Wi-Fi sensor is more privacy friendly. Wi-Fi signals cannot capture as much personally identifiable information as cameras can. They are incapable of facial recognition and cannot read documents and computer screens. Wi-Fi sensing can operate in an essential place between motion sensors and cameras, protecting the anonymity of people while also being able to tell the difference between, say, a dog and a child. This may be useful for doing things like turning on and off lights and temperature control in houses. These sensors are also capable of operating in situations where there is reduced visibility due to a lack of light or the presence of smoke. This would make Wi-Fi sensing useful for firefighters looking for people in burning buildings or parents who want to monitor their children at night without recording invasive videos. The sky is the limit for this new technology. Who knows what other uses people will find for Wi-Fi sensing?
