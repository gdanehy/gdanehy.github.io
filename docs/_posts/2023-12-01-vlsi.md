# MOS VLSI Circuit Design Final Project

For the final project of my EE477 class at usc we were tasked with making a VLSI circuit containing a Multiplier, Arbiter, and Divider. This was a group project, and I was in charge of designing the Multiplier and Arbiter.

Full System:

## Multiplier
The following circuit is a four bit multiplier

The multiplier contains and gates, half adders, and full adders.

## Arbiter
The arbiter decides which section can access the single output.

In this screenshot of the extracted view, we can see that when just M requests the output, it receives the output (MD goes high, indicating multiplier), likewise for D. When neither requests S is set to one, indicating that the output should stall. At 16ns, when both m and d request, m is granted output because d had outputted previously.
