  <h1 id="booch-bot---a-capstone-project">Booch Bot - a capstone project</h1>
<p>For my electrical engineering capstone class we were tasked with making a device to make someones life better in some way. This was a very broad topic, which gave us a lot of creative freedom in deciding what we would build. My group decided we wanted to make a Kombucha brewing system.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Booch_Bot/Booch_Demo.jpeg" alt="Schematic" title="Schematic" /></p>

<p>The following is the final report for the class:</p>

<h2 id="problem-description">Problem Description</h2>
<p>Kombucha is a fermented drink that has been around for thousands of years but only gained popularity in the United States over the last 20 years. Kombucha’s rise has been strongly tied to the growing number of health-conscious consumers attracted to the health benefits connected to kombucha. From probiotics that help support a healthy gut to antioxidants and polyphenols that help reduce inflammation, there is a reason kombucha has been touted in traditional medicine for millennia.</p>

<p>Today, kombucha is growing rapidly in both the commercial scene, where the market is expected to increase from just over $3 billion to over $9 billion by 2030, and with home brewers, where “how-to” videos and guides have millions of views. While kombucha is growing and becoming more available nationally at grocery and convenience stores, it still might not be available commercially for many outside of large cities. For this reason, we hope to make brewing kombucha at home easier and more beginner-friendly.</p>

<p>Homebrewing comes with its own anxiety and worries that we hope to alleviate. The process of brewing Kombucha can take several weeks and goes through several phases of fermentation, where factors like temperature and light exposure can have effects on the outcome of the brew. It can be stressful to not know what is going on, and there is no hand holding to tell you if you are making any mistakes. During the kombucha brewing process, yeasts take sugar and turn it into ethanol and carbon dioxide. Normally, bacteria should then convert the ethanol into acetic acid, but this process can be disrupted if the kombucha is not provided with enough oxygen, leading to the presence of alcohol in the drink. This could be a cause for concern for people who cannot drink alcohol, for example, people who are pregnant, underage, have health conditions, or have cultural stipulations relating to alcohol consumption.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The BoochBot offers a start-to-finish monitoring system to help brewers better understand their brews. BoochBot displays the active brew time and temperature of the brew, allowing for better consistency between brews. The temperature measurements are also used with user settings to operate a heating pad that regulates the temperature of the brew. In addition, BoochBot monitors for the potential presence of alcohol and offers a warning to brewers if it detects alcohol.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is not an easy way to measure the alcohol content of a liquid directly at home. Instead, most home breweries will either measure the change in sugar content with a refractometer or measure the change in the density of the liquid with a hydrometer. These measurements can then be extrapolated to determine approximately how much alcohol is in the liquid.</p>

<p>We decided to go the buoyancy measurement route after learning about the open source project iSpindel, an electronic tilt hydrometer inside a test tube. The device measures the alcohol content by recording the temperature and angle that it sits in the liquid. These measurements can be used to find the density, and therefore the alcohol content, of the liquid. The iSpindel concept is great, but it lacked some of the functionality we required. The main issue being it only communicated via Wi-Fi, and we wanted it to communicate directly with our main control board without the need for outside networks. So instead, we designed our own tilt hydrometer that used radio communication to relay data with the main board.

<p>The BoochBot Hydrometer was able to successfully measure temperature and tilt, however radio communication was unsuccessful. After several failed attempts to get wireless communication working, the team decided to pivot to using a wired temperature sensor and an alcohol gas sensor. The gas sensor is far less accurate than a tilt hydrometer, but does give the user some information regarding the presence of alcohol in the kombucha.

<p>Figure 8: Final Board</p>

<h3 id="atmega328p">ATmega328p</h3>
<p>The ATMega328p microcontroller is the brain of our Main board. It connects to all other components through its pins, either directly or through methods such as IIC.</p>

<h3 id="heating-pad-and-relay">Heating Pad and Relay</h3>
<p>The heating pad is the HoppsBrew Home Brew Heating Pad for Beer, Wine, Spirits. It draws 25 watts from a Type-A plug connected directly into an outlet. Because of the high power draw relative to all of our other components, we decided to still use wall power for the heating pad. The heating pad automatically activates once plugged in and can reach over 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Because the brewing range for kombucha is only 60–85 degrees, we cut the 2-wire cord in half and connected the live and neutral wires to a relay, which allowed us to better regulate the temperature and start heating the brew only when it was needed. We used the JQX-15F/005 relay via the SparkFun Beefcake Relay Control Kit. This relay was normally open, so to engage the relay and turn on the heating pad, the control pin is set high.</p>

<h3 id="real-time-clock">Real Time Clock</h3>
<p>The real-time clock (RTC) we chose to use was the Adafruit PCF8523 with a 12mm diameter, 3V backup battery. One issue we hypothesized was that, at some point during the brewing process, which can take several weeks, power could be lost and all the brewing progress would be as well. By using a stand-alone RTC that automatically counts up, all we need to do is reset the registers when we begin brewing and poll the RTC’s internally incrementing registers for seconds, minutes, hours, and days to know the current brewing time. In the event that power is lost, the backup 3V battery should keep the low-power RTC powered on to continue keeping track of the time elapsed since the brewing started. It is for this ease-of-use and redundancy that we chose not to use the built-in timers and counters of the ATmega328p. In our project, we successfully wrote functions to read and write from the RTC’s registers; however, we were unable to get the RTC to reliably continue counting up once power was lost, despite the attached 3V backup battery.</p>

<h3 id="lcd-screen">LCD Screen</h3>
<p>We chose to use a Crystalfontz 20x4 I2C LCD to display the brewing progress to the user because of its relatively easy set-up, low cost, and I2C interface that we were already planning to use for other components. For the purposes of this project, a smaller 20x2 I2C LCD could have been used to reduce cost and form factor further, and the functions we used could be easily repurposed.</p>

<h3 id="rotary-encoder">Rotary Encoder</h3>
<p>User inputs during the set-up are done using a rotary encoder with a push button. This allows users to rotate the encoder to increase and decrease the thresholds set up and confirm their choices with a button press. We elected to use the rotary encoder over other user inputs due to our personal familiarity with their operation and its compactness once placed on the board; however, this method can be a little sensitive when turning the encoder quickly, and the value can skip around.</p>

<h3 id="radio-transceiver-board">Radio Transceiver board</h3>
<p>We utilize the Adafruit RFM69HCW Transceiver Radio Breakout (Adafruit 3071) because the hydrometer design has all the components sealed in a buoyant capsule. We established it as a gateway node to receive a radio frequency signal at 433 MHz and respond with an acknowledged signal once the data packet is detected. Our microcontroller would then read the received packets, store the values for the x,y, and z orientations of the hydrometer, and compare them to previous values in order to determine the change in tilt across the brew time. This tilt measurement is an accurate way to measure the change in the sugar content and, proportionally, the amount of alcohol formed in the kombucha. This works because the sugar water is significantly more buoyant, and as the sugar converts to alcohol, the buoyancy decreases, which in turn changes the tilt at which the buoy floats.</p>

<h3 id="temperature-probe">Temperature Probe</h3>
<p>Our initial choice of measuring the brew’s temperature using the hydrometer’s Adafruit 4646 had to be changed to an Adafruit DS18B20 waterproof temperature probe after we faced complications with establishing radio communication to our main board. Needing to switch from a wireless approach, where the sensor never came in contact with the liquid of the brew, to a sensor that was directly contacting the liquid and connected to the board, we chose the DS18B20. There were some concerns about having certain materials come into contact with the fermenting liquid due to its lowered acidity. Reactive metals, aluminum, and plastics can all break down or leech into the brew over sustained periods or multiple brews and should be avoided when possible. The stainless steel cover on the DS18B20’s probe means that it should be safe for prolonged exposure to the brew. This, along with its low cost and ease of use, is why we chose it for our project.</p>

<h3 id="ethanol-vapor-probe">Ethanol Vapor Probe</h3>
<p>In the project version without a tilt sensor to measure alcohol content, we chose to use an MQ3 alcohol sensor to detect potential alcohol. Although we cannot read back measured alcohol values from the MQ3, we are able to set an ethanol threshold for it to detect in the air of the container and trigger an alert if passed. This method should work well in a sealed environment, such as during the second fermentation cycle, when accidental alcohol production is most common. This is due to any ethanol vapor being trapped above the liquid, where the MQ3 is.</p>

<h3 id="hydrometer">Hydrometer</h3>

<p>Figure 9 and 10: Tilt layout and schematic</p>

<h3 id="gyroscope--temperature-sensor">Gyroscope + Temperature sensor</h3>
<p>The hydrometer design utilized the 9-DOF Absolute Orientation IMU (Adafruit 4646), which is a board with an accelerometer, gyroscope, and a temperature sensor. The outputs of the board include the absolute orientation, angular velocity vector, acceleration vector, magnetic field strength vector, gravity vector, and temperature. The board stores the readings at a frequency of 100 Hz which can then be read from their respective registers using an i2c write and read function. For our purposes, we only used the orientation readings in order to calculate the change in tilt of the sensor over the time of the brew and the temperature readings to record temperature and measure whether it is within the threshold ranges. While the Adafruit 4646 is not waterproof or intended immediately for liquids, by containing it in a buoyant, waterproof capsule that would be placed within the brew, we didn’t have an issue.</p>

<h3 id="microcontroller--radio">Microcontroller + Radio</h3>
<p>Because the hydrometer design involved placing the Adafruit 4646 in a sealed buoyant capsule, we had to include a way to communicate with the main board of the device. We opted to use an Adafruit Feather 32u4 with RFM69HCW Packet Radio (Adafruit 3077), which would communicate with the Adafruit 4646 via I2C. It would then transmit the data using a 433 MHz radio frequency to the Adafruit 3071 transceiver breakout board on the main device board. It would send the orientation data as x,y, and z values as well as the temperature reading in a packet and then look for an acknowledge response signal to indicate that the transceiver breakout board successfully received the data packets. The Adafruit 3077 microcontroller and Adafruit 4646 were powered by a 3.7 V rechargeable Li-Po battery with 650 mAh.</p>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>In this project, we tried to use 433MHz radio to communicate between the Main Board and the Hydrometer. This proved to be extremely challenging. Because we were using the bare ATMega chip, we were unable to use existing libraries to facilitate this communication. When we wrote our own code, we were unable to debug where the communication disconnect was, as we were stuck in a catch-22 of needing the receiver to test the transmitter and the transmitter to test the receiver. From what we can see through the serial monitor on the Adafruit 3077 Feather, the transceiver was successfully sending out the data packets on a 433 Mhz radio frequency but never received the acknowledged signal back. On the other side, the transceiver was claiming to be searching for a 433 Mhz signal but was unable to find one. We experimented with different antenna lengths but were unable to identify the issue between the nodes. In the end, we had to go with the wired minimum viable product option using the ethanol sensor.</p>

<p>An alternative communication protocol for a future BoochBot would be Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). In the BLE standard, there are Peripheral devices which send data, and Central devices which receive data. We initially shied away from this option due to its relative complexity and its lack of support for communication back and forth between microcontrollers. However, we actually only need one-way communication, which means BLE is an option after all. In this project, the Hydrometer would be the peripheral, and the Main Board would be the Central device. For the Hydrometer, we could use a board like the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2, which includes a gyroscope and temperature sensor. As for the central device, the easiest thing seems to be adding another microcontroller with BLE capability and communicating with the existing ATMega chip via IIC, or just replacing the ATMega with it outright.</p>

<p>Another thing we attempted to address was a fail-safe in the event that power is lost during brewing. If someone is several days into brewing, the loss of power and brewing data could ruin a brew and be quite frustrating. Our approach saved the brewing timer and temperature range that the user selected to the EEPROM of the ATmega328p. That way, if power is lost, the RTC should continue keeping track of the time elapsed thanks to its backup battery. In our testing, we were correctly saving the system’s state along with the brewing parameters; however, a power outage caused errors with the RTC. Once power was restored, the time values being read from the RTC across the seconds, minutes, hours, and days registers would have all changed, seemingly at random. We then attempted to also store the time values to the EEPROM during the brewing process and then replace any values in the RTC with those if power was lost and restored. This would have only had the system pick up where it left off, meaning long-term power outages would cause the system to brew for much longer than desired, but we ended up facing the same issue as before, with strange values being read and displayed from the RTC, with the seconds and minutes displaying values well over 60, which should cause a rollover with the register.</p>

<p>The final estimated cost for our device is around 55 dollars for the single board BoochBot, 125 dollars for the radio BoochBot, and 115 dollars for the BLE BoochBot. These prices could be brought down in the final version if we create our own PCB and use bare chips instead of breakout boards. Additionally, If we were making multiple devices, we would be able to buy parts in bulk at a discounted price.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>We were able to create a system that can monitor and regulate the temperature of the kombucha brewing process. Users can set a timer for the brew as well as a temperature range they want the system to try and maintain. Thanks to the temperature probe and heating pad, we are able to measure the brew’s temperature and regulate the temperature if it drops below the range that the user sets. Once the brew timer finishes, the system tells the user that the brewing is done via the LCD screen and flashes a green LED to get the brewer’s attention. After the timer runs out, the system displays a warning if ethanol was detected at any point during the brewing process.
We were unable to fully ensure proper operation after a power loss, which should be addressed if this project is further developed. Although we were unable to detect the exact reason for this error, it was likely the fault of a faulty battery in the RTC. We were unable to provide a way to measure the specific alcohol content of a brew, which, if displayed to the user throughout the brewing process, would provide them with more insight into what their brew is doing and potentially make corrections before too much alcohol is produced.
Overall, this project is a good first step towards what we believe could be a commercially viable product.</p>
